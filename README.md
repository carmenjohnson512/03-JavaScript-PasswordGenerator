# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

I've created an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by my JavaScript code. It also features a clean and polished user interface with responsive design, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## User Story

```
Employees with access to sensitive data want the ability to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria in order to create a strong password that provides greater data security.
```

## Project Notes

```
Users have the option to create a unique password based on the following criteria:
- Password length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
- A choice of character types from the following options: uppercase, numeric and special characters, and lowercase
- User input is validated and at least one character type should be selected or no password output will be returned
- When all prompts are answered, users must press the "generate password" button to generate a unique password that matches the selected criteria
- When the password is generated, it is displayed in the designated text box on the page
- Users also have the ability to reset their input choices using the "reset password button"
```
